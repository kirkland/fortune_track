Generally speaking, a report is just a subset of accounts, with their line items summed up over some
period of time. A balance sheet is a special case where the start date is the beginning of time.

To generate a report, need:
-- A list of accounts, or method to generate list.
-- Start date (none if balance sheet).
-- End date.

Display options:
-- Should accounts show their transaction totals only, or include children's as well?
-- Percentage of total.
-- Percent of parent and siblings total.
